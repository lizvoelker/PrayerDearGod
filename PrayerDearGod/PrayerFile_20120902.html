<h2>Dear God,</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for the many blessings and provisions you have given me.  I know that you are the only one who can meet all of my needs.  Help me to remember that as I go through this day.  As I trust in you, please give me your peace that surspasses all understanding.<p>
